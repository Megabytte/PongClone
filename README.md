PongClone
=========

A clone of Pong using Java and LWJGL

As part of my ongoing learning of LWJGL I created a simple Pong Clone that has many issues, random files, unoptimized code
and bugs. It was just a demo but I backed up the code to practice using git and Github so I could use them for the Tetris
Clone I'm going to start work on soon.
